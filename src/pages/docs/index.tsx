        content: `In the simplest terms, Web3 refers to applications that are decentralized and run on a blockchain. While we'll get more into what a blockchain is, the core concept behind web3 as a whole is that everything is distributed over an open peer-to-peer network, as opposed to our current system where everything is stored on private servers. The concept allows for both a much more open and public network, as well as creating something that is incredibly permanent.

        heading: 'Blockchain',
        content: `A blockchain can be thought of as a type of digital ledger that is immutable, meaning it can't be altered. It's made up of “blocks”. Each block serves as a sort of “receipt”, containing all the information that was recorded when the block was created (a record of a transaction made). Each block has a unique hash (id) as well as the hash of the previous block in the chain, which is the principal method of security. The main attraction of a blockchain is that it is decentralized — meaning they are widely distributed and anyone can obtain a copy of the blockchain.

The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system. To use cryptocurrencies, you need a cryptocurrency wallet. These wallets can be software that is a cloud-based service or is stored on your computer or on your mobile device. The wallets are the tool through which you store your encryption keys that confirm your identity and link to your cryptocurrency.

        content: `Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.

        heading: `More about Solana's Blockchain network`,
        content: `Solana achieves consensus using a proof-of-stake mechanism and its model, known as "proof-of-history" mechanism. Proof of history enables the network to operate faster because nodes do not need to communicate to validate a block. The Solana white-paper describes this design as a decentralised clock. Proof of history enables network participants to have a high degree of certainty that an event took place at a specific moment in time. An example of proof of history is when a person takes a picture of today's newspaper with the date and time recorded so that it can be used to verify the newspaper in the future.

          Ethereum 1.0 relies on a proof of work consensus mechanism, which is the same mechanism used by Bitcoin's blockchain. This means that the network is protected by miners, who use their computational power to validate blockchain transactions and generate new blocks. This is the essence of the decentralised network, and it serves to increase the security of the network.  However, the PoW mechanism can only process a few transactions per second, which is a huge impediment to a growing decentralised network.
          
          Solana is different from Ethereum in that it uses proof of history. In essence, it requires a series of computational steps to determine the cryptographical time between two events. This order sequencing is fundamentally different from the one in Bitcoin or Ethereum, where transactions are not placed in a  timely manner.
          
          Another essential difference between Ethereum and Solana is its “stateless” architecture. This helps to reduce memory consumption. Because the entire network's state does not need to be updated for every transaction, transactions can be performed sequentially. This makes Solana extremely scalable.

The blockchain emphasises speed and scalability as Solana can process transactions more economically and faster than, for example, Ethereum. Solana's execution environment is based on eBPF, which allows the Rust, C, and C++ programming languages to be used.
